                <p id="firstp">The United Nations Space Command (UNSC) is the military, exploratory, and scientific
                    agency of humanity in the Halo series. It was originally formed to oversee space colonization and
                    protect Earth's interstellar interests. As tensions rose between Earth and its outer colonies, the
                    UNSC became increasingly militarized, eventually playing a key role in suppressing rebellion and
                    maintaining order.</p>

                    brilliance, advanced AI like Cortana, and the deployment of elite soldiers known as Spartansâ€”most
                    notably, Master Chief. The UNSC remains central to humanity's survival and efforts to understand
                    ancient alien technology known as Forerunner artifacts.</p>
